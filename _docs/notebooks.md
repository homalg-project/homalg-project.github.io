# [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks

Some functionality of the packages is demonstrated in the notebooks found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/).

## Running the notebooks on Binder

You can interactively run the notebooks online by visiting the above link and clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.

## Running the notebooks on your machine

You can clone the repository containing these notebooks [here](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks).

These are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which require the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages
* [`IJulia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#readme) to launch in the browser and
* [`HomalgProject`](https://github.com/homalg-project/HomalgProject.jl#readme) to run.
