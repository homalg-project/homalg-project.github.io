# [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks

Some functionality of the packages is demonstrated in the following [notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/). These are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which require the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages
* [`IJulia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#readme) to launch in the browser and
* [`HomalgProject`](https://github.com/homalg-project/HomalgProject.jl#readme) to run.
