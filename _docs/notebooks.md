# [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks

Some functionality of the packages is demonstrated in the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/).

## Running the notebooks on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

You can interactively run the notebooks online by visiting the above link and clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.

## Running the notebooks on your machine

You can clone the repository containing these notebooks [here](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks).

The notebooks require the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages
* [`IJulia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#readme) to launch [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) in the browser and load the notebooks, and
* [`CapAndHomalg`](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalg.jl#readme) to run them interactively.
