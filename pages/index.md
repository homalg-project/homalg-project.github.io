# The GitHub organization homalg-project

The GitHub organization [homalg-project](https://github.com/homalg-project/) hosts several computer algebra packages, most of which are based on the

* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project#readme) ([swMATH](https://swmath.org/software/27925) entry)
* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project#readme) ([swMATH](https://swmath.org/software/411) entry)

Here you can find an overview of (almost) all packages

* [based on the CAP project](/docs/CAP_project-based/)
* [based on the homalg project](/docs/homalg_project-based/)

## Notebooks

Some functionality of the packages is demonstrated in the notebooks found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/). There you can also interactively run the notebooks online by clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.

For more details see [here](/docs/notebooks).
