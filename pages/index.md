# The GitHub organization homalg-project

The GitHub organization
[homalg-project](https://github.com/homalg-project/) hosts several
computer algebra packages, most of which are based on the

* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project#readme) ([swMATH](https://swmath.org/software/27925) entry)
* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project#readme) ([swMATH](https://swmath.org/software/411) entry)

Here you can find an overview of (almost) all packages

* [based on the CAP project](/docs/CAP_project-based/)
* [based on the homalg project](/docs/homalg_project-based/)

## Jupyter notebooks

[Here](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalgNotebooks#readme)
you can find a list of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
demonstrating the functionality of the various
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) packages, most
of which are part on the four projects:

* [homalg_project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project#readme),
* [CAP_project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project#readme),
* [CategoricalTowers](https://github.com/homalg-project/CategoricalTowers#readme),
* [HigherHomologicalAlgebra](https://github.com/homalg-project/HigherHomologicalAlgebra#readme).

All included [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) packages can be accessed
through the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package
[CapAndHomalg](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalg.jl#readme).
