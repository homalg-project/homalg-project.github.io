# The GitHub organization homalg-project

The GitHub organization [homalg-project](https://github.com/homalg-project/) hosts several computer algebra packages, most of which are based on the

* [CAP project](/docs/CAP_project/),
* [homalg project](/docs/homalg_project/).

Here you can find an overview of (almost) all packages

* [based on the CAP project](/docs/CAP_project-based/),
* [based on the homalg project](/docs/homalg_project-based/).

## Notebooks

Some functionality of the packages is demonstrated in the following [notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/CapHomalgNotebooks/tree/master/). These are [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks which require the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) packages
* [`IJulia`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl#readme) to launch in the browser and
* [`HomalgProject`](https://github.com/homalg-project/HomalgProject.jl#readme) to run.
